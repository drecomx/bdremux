bdremux - a blu-ray movie stream remuxer <fraxinas@opendreambox.org>

Usage: ./bdremux source_stream.ts output_stream.m2ts [OPTION...]

Optional arguments:
  -e, --entrypoints               Generate and display the SPN/PTS map
  -c, --cutlist                   use enigma2's $source_stream.ts.cuts file
  -q, --queue-size=INT            max size of queue in bytes (default=50331648)
  -s, --source-pids=STRING        list of PIDs to be considered
  -r, --result-pids=STRING        list of PIDs in resulting stream
     PIDs can be supplied in decimal or hexadecimal form (0x prefixed)
     the lists are supposed to be comma-seperated with the Video PID
     as the first element followed by 1-7 Audio PIDs.
     If omitted, the first video and all audio elementary streams are
     carried over, keeping their PIDs (this may require a larger queue size).

Help options:
  -?, --help                      Show this help message
  -v, --version                   Display GSTREAMER version

Example: ./bdremux in.ts out.m2ts -e -s0x40,0x4A,0x4C -r0x1011,0x1100,0x1101
  Will extract the video elementary stream with PID 0x40 and the audio
  streams with PIDs 0x41 and 0x4C from the file in.ts and write new
  remultiplexed streams with PID numbers 0x1011 for video and 0x1100
  and 0x1101 for audio into the file out.m2ts while showing a map
  of entrypoints on stdout.
